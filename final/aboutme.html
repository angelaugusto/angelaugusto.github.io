      <P>
        I am Graphic Designer from the Dominican Republic. Looking for expanding my design knowledges, I flew to Boston in 2010. I am currently attending to Massachusetts College of Art and Design.
        I am available for freelance graphic design work and internships. Get in touch, I'd love to hear about your project.
